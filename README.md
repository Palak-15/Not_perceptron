# Not Perceptron
Not Gate is high when both the input is low, otherwise it is high. As you can see in below Truth Table. In this I make a Not Perceptron which is working with the given weights. It is just like an inverter.

#### Dependencies
* pandas

I used Sublime text editor. You can use any text editor.
```sh
In this Linear combination is used  wx+b=y where w is the weights, x is the inputs and b is bias.
```
| INPUT 1       | OUTPUT          
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 0      | 1 |
| 1     | 0  |
